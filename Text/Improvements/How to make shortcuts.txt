How to make shortcuts:

if multiple deaths are located within two checkpoints:
	- this would have to be a list created, of length mapflagcoords. With each death when heading towards a next flag be marked
	- if one element of this list = 2x (?) more than the list mean average, then a shortcut is created prior to that flag’s previous flag (ie, the start of the path which is dangerous)
**make shortcut**
- prior to shortcut being made, the start position of the shortcut replaces the “flag’s previous flag” element that we mentioned previously
    - the end of the shortcut [shortcuts can only be straight lines] replaces the flag marked as dangerous
- once shortcut is made, replace the number of deaths in the deathList (see earlier) with [either 0 or list’s mean average (?)]
- MAKE SURE THAT DEATHLIST ACCOUNTS FOR CHANGE IN FLAGLIST!

Additional note:
- could make it so tunneller creeps only begin to spawn when this deathList condition is met?
- Or, if after a certain amount of time, no creeps are reaching the finish, find the location with the highest deaths and then spawn a tunneller to shortcut that area instead?
