(could all be made up of dictionaries(?) - does that make sense?)

For each Creep:
- Species     : string             (to allow reference to bible)
- Position    : list(always of length 2)
                (list: an array with a dynamic length & can be updated)
- Direction   : direction variable of type string = [N, E, S, W]
- HP          : integer
- Debuffs (?) : list
other?

For each Tower:
- Type     : string
- Position : list(always of length 2)
- Target   : list(always of length 2)   (used to determine either N, E, S or W direction of sprite)
- HP?      : integer (from 'total health of that type' .. '0')
- Upgrade  : integer (from '0' .. 'total number of upgrades for that type')
